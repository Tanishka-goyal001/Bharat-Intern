###BHARAT-INTERN Projects


Welcome to the Bharat Intern Data Science projects repository! This collection of projects showcases various data science applications and techniques, ranging from predictive modeling to data analysis and visualization. Each project aims to solve real-world problems and provide insights into data-driven decision-making. This README offers an overview of the projects, their objectives, and how to get started.


###PROJECTS DESCRIPTIONS


###1)Stock Predictions
Welcome to the Stock Price Prediction Data Science Project repository! This project focuses on predicting stock prices using data science techniques.The project utilizes historical stock price data obtained from kaggle to build and train an LSTM model that can forecast future stock prices with high degree of accuracy.


###Titanic Classifications
Welcome to the Titanic Survival Classification Data Science Project repository! This project focuses on predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using data science techniques.For this project,classification algorithm like Logistic Regression,accuracy_score and train_test_split to split the data into train/test to check and avoif overfitting has been used.


###Datasets
The datasets used in these projects are well-preprocessed and relevant to the specific problem domains. The data exploration and preprocessing steps are thoroughly documented in the project notebooks, providing valuable insights into the process of transforming raw data into actionable information.The files for datasets are also attached for clarity.


###Usage
Each project is contained within its own dedicated directory, complete with Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) that walk you through the entire process, from data loading and exploration to model building and evaluation. You can follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the notebooks to understand the methodologies used and reproduce the analyses on your own machine.


###Dependencies
To run the notebooks and experiment with the code, you'll need to have a Python environment set up with the necessary libraries and packages. We recommend using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts. You can install the required packages using the provided requirements.txt file in each project directory.


###Contributions
Contributions to this repository are more than welcome! If you find any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or want to add your own take on the projects, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's learn and grow together!
